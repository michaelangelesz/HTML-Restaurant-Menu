        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p><!-- chatGPT fictional filler: -->
            H-Thai-ML started as a small family affair in Wilson, NC, when the owner, Mali, moved to the United States from Thailand to start a new life with her husband and children. Mali brought with her a passion for cooking and a love for the flavors and spices of her homeland.<br><br>
    
            In the beginning, Mali started cooking traditional Thai dishes in her home kitchen and sharing them with friends and family. Her food was so delicious that word quickly spread, and soon people from all over the town were asking her to cook for them.<br><br>
            
            Mali and her family decided to open a small restaurant in Wilson, serving authentic Thai cuisine using the freshest ingredients and traditional cooking techniques. The restaurant quickly became a local favorite, with people coming from all over the area to sample Mali's delicious food.<br><br>
            
            As the restaurant's popularity grew, Mali and her family decided to expand, opening new locations in Rocky Mount, Raleigh, and Greenville. Despite the growth, H-Thai-ML remains a family-owned and operated business, with Mali's children and grandchildren all working together to carry on her legacy of exceptional food and warm hospitality.<br></p>
